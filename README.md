# myRIO-8BitCounter
### Introduction
------
This is a beginner myRIO project to create an 8-bit counter with LEDs, a breadboard, and the DIO lines on port C of a National Instruments myRIO.

### Requirements
This project is designed to run on a National Instruments myRIO using the LabVIEW myRIO Toolkit. In addition to the myRIO, other hardware used in this project are:

* 8 LEDs
* 8 350 Ohm Resistors
* 1 breadboard
* 10 male-to-male jumper wires

### Circuit Diagram
